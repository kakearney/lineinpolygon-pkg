function [anyIn, inSegment, outSegment] = lineinpolygon(x1, y1, x2, y2, xv, yv)
%LINEINPOLYGON Looks for segments of a line within a polygon
%
% [anyIn, inSegment, outSegment] = lineinpolygon(x1, y1, x2, y2, xv, yv)
%
% This program looks at a straight line and a closed polygon and determines
% which segments of the line are located inside the polygon.
%
% Input variables:
%
%   x1:         x coordinate of line starting point
%
%   y1:         y coordinate of line starting point
%
%   x2:         x coordinate of line ending point
%
%   y2:         y coordinate of line ending point
%
%   xv:         x coordinates of vertices of polygon
%
%   yv:         y coordinates of vertices of polygon
%
% Output variables:
%
%   anyIn:      true if any portion of the line is located in the polygon
%
%   inSegment:  n x 2 [x y] array of line segments located inside the
%               polygon.  Segments are separated by NaNs.
%
%   outSegment: n x 2 [x y] array of line segments located outside the
%               polygon.  Segments are separated by NaNs.
